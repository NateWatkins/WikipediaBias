## Abstract
Our project focuses on indentifying bias from Wikipedia by looking at article size, number of refrences, and history of edits. We want to connect how editing behavior can correlate to systemic bias or other underlying patterns. 


## Methodology
- Found 25 most contraversial persons from each gender -> we will extrapolate to 50,100 people to analyze trends
- Found the averages of length and number of refrences then look at findings


## Results
- 25 People
      - 5000 bit length difference between genders
      - 60 more refrences on pages for women

  

## Potential Questions:
- Does Google’s search ranking of Wikipedia amplify systemic bias by making it the “first source” people read?
- Do Wikipedia’s content gaps reveal more about bias than the content itself?
- What do Wikipedia's content gaps show about the overall bias of the site?

At what point can a socially accepted lie become fact in Wikipedia

- Analyzing bias from a gender stand point
        - Do wikipedia editors spend more time on pages for women than men?
