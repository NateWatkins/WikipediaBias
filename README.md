## Potential Questions:
Does Google’s search ranking of Wikipedia amplify systemic bias by making it the “first source” people read?
Do Wikipedia’s content gaps reveal more about bias than the content itself?
- What do Wikipedia's content gaps show about the overall bias of the site?

At what point can a socially accepted lie become fact in Wikipedia
