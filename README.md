##Abstract
Our project focuses on indentifying bias from Wikipedia by looking at article size, number of refrences, and history of edits. We want to connect how editing behavior can correlate to systemic bias or other underlying patterns. 


## Methodology
- Use the Wikipedia API program to collect article metadata such as length in bytes, number of references, and last edited timestamp.  
- Identify and track patterns of growth and references over time.  
- Connect these metadata points to questions of bias and systemic gaps.  


## Potential Questions:
Does Google’s search ranking of Wikipedia amplify systemic bias by making it the “first source” people read?
Do Wikipedia’s content gaps reveal more about bias than the content itself?
- What do Wikipedia's content gaps show about the overall bias of the site?

At what point can a socially accepted lie become fact in Wikipedia
