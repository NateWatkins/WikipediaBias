\section{Introduction}
Wikipedia is widely used for quick fact-finding, while news outlets shape public narratives in real time. This paper sets up a pilot to compare framing bias between the two on politically charged topics. 
We describe the research questions, why the comparison matters for public trust, and how the pilot will be run. We stop short of findings; the goal here is clarity about design and measurement.
